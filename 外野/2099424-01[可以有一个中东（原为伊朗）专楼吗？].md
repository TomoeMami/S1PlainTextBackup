 <blockquote>（早报讯）一名巴勒斯坦枪手星期五（1月27日）在东耶路撒冷的一座犹太教堂里开枪，造成至少七人死亡，另外三人受伤。枪手已被击毙。

新华社和路透社综合报道，以色列jg发表声明说，事件发生在东耶路撒冷一处犹太人定居点，枪手行凶后试图驾车逃离现场，被追捕的警察打死。这名枪手21岁，来自东耶路撒冷舒阿法特社区。

耶路撒冷地区jg负责人多龙·图尔格曼说，此次枪击事件是“近年来最严重的袭击之一”，jg将对邻近地区进行持续搜查。

美国总统拜登指示国家安全团队向以色列同行提供支持。

白宫发言人让-皮埃尔说：“我们强烈谴责今晚在耶路撒冷一座犹太教堂发生的恐怖袭击，并对人员伤亡感到震惊和悲痛。”她说：“这次袭击发生在国际大屠杀纪念日，这是一个世界各地纪念大屠杀丧生者的日子。”

加拿大和阿拉伯联合酋长国也对东耶路撒冷犹太教堂枪击事件表示谴责。

巴以地区紧张局势近期有所加剧。26日上午，以军在约旦河西岸北部城市杰宁与巴勒斯坦人发生冲突，造成至少九名巴勒斯坦人死亡。27日凌晨，数枚火箭弹从加沙地带向以色列发射，以军则采取报复行动，出动战机轰炸哈马斯（巴勒斯坦**抵抗运动）在加沙地带的军事目标。</blockquote>https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-729860
 <blockquote>'One of the worst attacks we have known in recent years'

"This was one of the worst attacks we have known in recent years, our hearts go out to the families of the wounded and dead. We have assessed the situation and decided on some immediate actions, we will act decisively and calmly," Netanyahu said in a statement in the Jerusalem Police headquarters hours after the attack.</blockquote>内塔尼亚胡称“这是近年来最严重的袭击之一”

 <blockquote>Iran’s Tasnim News, which is considered close to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, portrayed the terror attack as a possible revenge for the clashes in Jenin in which nine Palestinians were killed in clashes between Palestinian gunmen and Israeli forces. Iran’s Fars News also reported about the attack but was more general in its discussion. 

Tasnim said the “operation” may be related to the clashes in Jenin. It adds that Israel is concerned about more incidents happening. The report says “so far, at least eight Zionists have been killed and five others have been injured. Some sources have announced the number of injured Zionists at 12…The latest news indicates that the person responsible for the big operation against the occupiers in the occupied Jerusalem has been martyred. This young fighter continued to shoot until the moment of his martyrdom.” </blockquote>耶路撒冷邮报转述塔斯社：“伊朗人已经在开香槟了”

伊朗国防部称 发生在伊斯法罕一处军事设施的无人机袭击被成功阻止，1架无人机被击落， 2架无人机在被捕获后爆炸该军事设施屋顶受到轻微损伤，无人员伤亡报告
 <blockquote>In a statement released early on Sunday, the Ministry said that one of three drones attacking the defense equipment manufacturing complex in Isfahan was downed by a defense system stationed inside the facility and two others exploded after being caught in traps set by the defense system.

The statement said the unsuccessful drone attack, which happened late on Saturday, failed because of preparedness of the defense system stationed in the region.

It said the attack had no casualties and only caused slight damage on the roof of the defense equipment facility.

“Thanks to God’s blessing, the attack caused no disruption to the equipment and the operations of the complex,” said the statement.</blockquote>

The drive网站 综合推特及其他开源信息称伊朗多地发生爆炸，有多处爆炸现场视频

微博 @飞扬军事铁背心 综合爆炸地点如下
 <blockquote>推文称伊朗西北部和中部多个地点发生爆炸：

-伊斯法罕省伊斯法罕

-西阿塞拜疆省科伊

-东阿塞拜疆省阿扎沙赫尔

-东阿塞拜疆省大不里士

-阿尔博尔茨省卡拉杰

-德黑兰纳尔马克

-哈马丹省哈马丹

但是据伊朗方面消息称，是伊斯法罕的MEK恐怖组织用三架自制小型无人机实施袭击导致，这些无人机被伊朗防空系统拦截。没有人员伤亡，发生爆炸的工厂的损失也很有限。

袭击者采用的不是军用无人机，而是构造简单的自制的自杀式无人机。</blockquote>https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-729949

耶路撒冷邮报称 遭袭击设施可能和无人机生产有关
 <blockquote>Was the attack linked to Iran's supply of drones to Russia?

Reports on social media have suggested a number of reasons for the incidents, linking this to Iran’s supply of drones to Russia to linking it to Israel-Iran tensions and tensions between Iran and the international community.  

Over the last several years Iran has expanded its drone and missile manufacturing facilities. Jason Brodsky, an expert on Iran, tweeted “this operation tonight targeting the MODAFL facility in Esfahan had a similar modus operandi to the one from June 2021 which attacked the TESA Karaj facility. In the latter, the drones were launched from inside Iran.”

Iran has also continued to enrich uranium as part of its nuclear program at several sites in the country. The various reports, such as at Iran International, seem to indicate the site in Isfahan was an “ammunition” facility.</blockquote>

目前还没确实证据是不是“人民**者”（MEK）对这几次袭击负责

个人猜测伊朗这次不是什么大事，MEK整活的因素居多？

或者摩萨德和MEK联手了？

目前还没确实证据是不是“人民**者”（MEK）对这几次袭击负责

个人猜测伊朗这次不是什么大事，MEK整活的 ...</blockquote><blockquote>DUBAI/WASHINGTON, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Israel appears to have been behind an overnight drone attack on a military factory in Iran, a U.S. official said on Sunday.

Iran claimed to have intercepted drones that struck a military industry target near the central city of Isfahan, and said there were no casualties or serious damage.

The extent of damage could not be independently ascertained. Iranian state media released footage showing a flash in the sky and emergency vehicles at the scene.

A spokesperson for the Israeli military declined to comment. Arch-foe Israel has long said it is willing to strike Iranian targets if diplomacy fails to curb Tehran's nuclear or missile programmes, but it has a policy of withholding comment on specific incidents.

Pentagon spokesperson Brigadier General Patrick Ryder said no U.S. military forces were involved in strikes in Iran, but declined to comment further.

That U.S. officials were pointing to an Israeli role in the attack was first reported by the Wall Street Journal, citing several unidentified sources. One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters it did appear that Israel was involved. Several other U.S. officials declined to comment, beyond saying that Washington played no role.</blockquote>

WSJ爆料，一名美国官员称以色列在幕后策划了本次针对伊朗的无人机袭击

 <blockquote>Israel is playing mum, but most Western intelligence and Iranian sources have credited the Mossad with similarly successful attacks against Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility in July 2020, a different Natanz nuclear facility in April 2021, another nuclear facility at Karaj in June 2021 and with destroying around 120 or more Iranian drones in February 2022.

Few organizations globally, besides the Mossad, are believed to possess the advanced and surgical strike capabilities displayed in the operation.</blockquote>

伊朗方面仍坚称袭击没有造成重大损失
 <blockquote>Earlier today, the Iranian Defense Ministry in a statement said that its air defense units have repelled a drone attack on a military workshop in the central city of Isfahan.

The ministry stated that one of its workshop complexes had come under attack from a number of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), but the complex's air defenses successfully repelled the attack.

It said the attack had no casualties and only caused slight damage on the roof of the defense equipment facility.

Three advanced quadcopters equipped with bomblets were used in this attack, and the security forces stationed in the complex, after hearing the sound of quadcopters, tried to counter these MAVs, which succeeded in intercepting one of them, informed sources told IRNA.

One of these quadcopters loses its GPS communication link due to jamming during the confrontation, leading to its falling and hitting the roof of a workshop.

The complex has previously experienced a similar case, and the arrangements taken after that incident will result in no significant damage to its workshops.

It should be noted that another of these quadcopters, which suffered less damage during the counter-operation, has been controlled by the security forces stationed in the complex.</blockquote>

伊朗的设施遭袭事件继续发酵

[https://tass.com/politics/1568861](https://tass.com/politics/1568861)

首先是俄罗斯谴责了此次袭击事件
 <blockquote>"We strongly condemn any provocative efforts that have the potential to provoke an uncontrolled escalation of tensions in a region that’s far from being peaceful as it is. Such destructive actions could have unpredictable consequences for peace and stability in the Middle East. That has to be understood by the organizers of the brazen raid, their backers and those who are gloating over the issue, holding on to the futile hope for the weakening of Iran,"</blockquote>

 <blockquote>A senior adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mykhailo Podolyak, expressed his joy over the attack. The top official stated that “Ukraine did warn you". Other Ukrainian officials have yet to publicly expand on his comments.

On Monday, Tehran summoned the charge d’affaires of Kiev to explain Podolyak’s remarks on Ukraine’s possible involvement in the strike.

Podolyak’s remarks come as a US official told Reuters that Israel appears to have been behind the drone attack.

Kiev and its Western allies have repeatedly claimed that Tehran has provided Russia with drones to be used in the war in Ukraine.

Iranian officials have repeatedly rejected claims about Tehran's arms sales to Russia to be used in the ongoing war against Ukraine, stressing such allegations are aimed at legitimizing the West's military assistance to Kiev.</blockquote>
