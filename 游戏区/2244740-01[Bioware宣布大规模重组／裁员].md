In order to break out beyond the core audience, games need to directly connect to the evolving demand of players who increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement alongside high-quality narratives in this beloved category. Dragon Age had a high-quality launch and was well-reviewed by critics and those who played. However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.

我们的爆款游戏故事策略主要围绕三个目标：第一，给核心玩家带来真实的故事体验；第二，搞点创新的、让人眼前一亮的玩法；第三，确保在PC和主机上都能高质量上线。要想突破核心玩家的圈子，游戏得跟上玩家需求的变化——现在大家不仅想要好故事，还想要能一起玩的共享世界和更深的互动体验。《龙腾世纪》这次发布质量挺高，媒体和玩家评价都不错，但在这个竞争超激烈的市场里，它还是没能吸引到足够多的玩家。</blockquote>
当你以为EA做了个不错的决策——啊不，DAVG开发经过了三个版本，第一个是原始RPG版，第二个是线上版，第三个是现版本，现在EA管理层明显觉得失败是因为没搞成线上服务版本
