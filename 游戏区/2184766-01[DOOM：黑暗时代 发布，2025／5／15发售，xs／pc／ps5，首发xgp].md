新访谈里透了点我感觉比较耐人寻味的内容： <blockquote>Will there be an enemy much like the Marauder, who will push the player to really learn the combat loop in this one?

将有敌人像掠夺者一样，推动玩家真正学会这个游戏的战斗循环吗？

Martin: Yeah, several. Those are the black belts on the battlefields, and we certainly have them. They will test your skill and knowledge and your ability with the parry system. So there are enemies who throw combos of attacks, and you don’t just parry one melee strike, you have to parry several in a row in order to falter them. The falter system definitely plays a role in this game, where parrying will falter enemies, so you’ll want to do that to help create openings for yourself.

马丁：是的，有几个。这些是战场上的黑带高手，我们当然有他们。他们会测试你的技能、知识以及你对格挡系统的运用能力。所以，有些敌人会连续发动攻击组合，你不仅要格挡一次近战攻击，还要连续格挡几次才能让他们失误。失误系统在这个游戏中确实扮演了角色，因为格挡可以使敌人失误，所以你想要这么做来为自己创造机会。</blockquote>
以及 <blockquote>How does the game dictate which of the three melee weapons to use when the button is pressed?

游戏如何决定在按下按钮时使用三种近战武器中的哪一种？

Martin: Well, you pre-select the melee weapon. There are three of them in the game, as I said. So not unlike swapping out equipment items in Eternal, you’ll swap to whichever. You can, through the dossier, pick whatever melee weapon you would like to use. Each has its strengths and weaknesses, and you progress throughout the level unlocking each one. You don’t start with all three. You start with the gauntlet, sort of the quicker, lighter one of the group, which I still love to use even in the endgame. And yeah, you charge them up, not unlike how you did blood punches in DOOM Eternal.

马丁：嗯，你预先选择近战武器。正如我所说，游戏中有三个，所以和永恒中的更换装备物品类似，你可以选择任何一个。你可以通过档案选择你想要的任何近战武器。每个都有其优势和劣势，你在关卡中前进时会解锁每一个。你不是一开始就拥有所有三个。你从护手开始，它是这个群体中更快、更轻的一个，即使在游戏后期，我也仍然喜欢使用它。而且，是的，你可以像在《永恒毁灭》中那样充能它们</blockquote>
