本作似乎只有近战。剧透打码。（来自[https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40315/silent-hill-f/](https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40315/silent-hill-f/)）

This is a survival-horror action game in which players assume the role of a student confronting supernatural entities in a 1960s Japanese mountain town. From a third-person perspective, players explore the town, solve puzzles, interact with characters, and battle enemy creatures (e.g., humanoid monsters, mutants, mythical creatures). Players use axes, crowbars, knives, and spears to defend against and kill enemy creatures in melee-style combat. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently as characters are attacked; several areas depict large bloodstains in the environment and near corpses. Some enemy attacks can result in players' character getting impaled in the neck and/or getting their faces ripped apart. Cutscenes sometimes depict gore and more intense acts of violence: a character burned alive inside a cage; a woman branded by a hot iron; entrails and sinew displayed on serving platters in fantastical celebration/ceremony; a character sawing off her own arm; a character slicing off portions of a character's face during a ritual. Concept art depicts a nude mannequin-like character, with exposed buttocks and partially exposed breasts; the character appears in a creature-like form throughout the game.

这是一款生存恐怖动作游戏，玩家扮演一名学生，在20世纪60年代的日本山城中对抗超自然实体。从第三人称视角，玩家探索小镇、解决谜题、与角色互动、与敌方生物（如人形怪物、变异体、神话生物）战斗。玩家使用斧头、撬棍、刀和长矛在近身战斗中抵挡和杀死敌方生物。角色受到攻击时经常会出现溅血效果；多个区域描绘了环境中和尸体附近的大片血迹。一些敌人的攻击可能会导致玩家角色的颈部被刺穿和/或脸部被撕碎。过场动画有时会描绘血腥和更激烈的暴力行为：一个角色被活活烧死在笼子里；一个女人被烙铁烙上印记；在奇幻的庆典/典礼中，内脏和筋腱被摆在餐盘上展示；一个角色锯断了她的胳膊；一个角色在仪式中切掉另一个角色的部分脸部。概念图描绘了一个裸体假人般的角色，臀部和部分**暴露在外；该角色在整个游戏中都以生物的形式出现。
